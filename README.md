# LOF-HDBSCAN
This is a course Project for CMPUT 697, Fall 2019. The goal of this project is to improve the clustering performance 
of HDBSCAN, a well-known hierarchical density based clustering algorithm by  automatically  removing  outliers.  
We  propose  6  different  methods  that  leverages  well  knownalgorithms to automatically remove outliers from data. 
Experiments on simulated data demonstratethat one of these variants, consistently performs well in automatic removal 
of noise, thus improving the performance of HDBSCAN
